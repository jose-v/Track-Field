# Coach-Athlete Invitation System

## Overview

The Track & Field application has a **secure, email-only** coach-athlete invitation system that operates through notifications and Supabase invitations. This system ensures privacy and security by requiring coaches to know an athlete's email address to invite them, and requiring explicit athlete approval before any coaching relationship is established.

## âœ… **Security Features** 

### **Email-Only Invitations**
- **No browsing athletes**: Coaches cannot browse or search through all athletes in the database
- **Email requirement**: Coaches must know the athlete's email address to send an invitation  
- **Privacy protection**: Athletes remain private until they choose to accept a coach's invitation

### **Approval-Based Relationships**
- **Pending by default**: All coach-athlete relationships start with `pending` status
- **Explicit approval required**: Athletes must explicitly approve or decline each invitation
- **Only approved athletes visible**: Coaches can only see athletes who have approved their requests
- **Notification system**: Athletes receive in-app notifications about coach requests

### **Supabase Integration**
- **Email invitations for new users**: Athletes not in the database receive Supabase invitation emails
- **Secure signup flow**: New users complete account creation through email verification
- **Metadata tracking**: Invitation context preserved through the signup process

## ðŸ“§ **Invitation Flow**

### **For Existing Athletes**
1. Coach enters athlete's email in the invitation modal

5. Athlete clicks email link â†’ redirected to `/coach-invitation` page
6. Athlete creates account through standard signup flow

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema**
```sql
-- Coach-athlete relationships with approval status
coach_athletes:
  - coach_id (UUID, FK to profiles)
  - athlete_id (UUID, FK to profiles)  
  - approval_status (ENUM: 'pending', 'approved', 'declined')
  - created_at (timestamp)
  - requested_at (timestamp)

-- In-app notifications
notifications:
  - user_id (UUID, FK to profiles)
  - title (text)
  - message (text)
  - type (text: 'coach_request', 'athlete_approval')
  - metadata (jsonb: {coach_id, athlete_id})
  - is_read (boolean)
  - created_at (timestamp)
```

### **Security Filters Applied**
- **useCoachAthletes hook**: Only returns `approval_status = 'approved'`
- **api.ts athletes.getByCoach()**: Filtered to approved relationships only
- **Meets functionality**: Only approved athletes can be assigned to meets
- **Chatbot service**: Only approved relationships for data queries
- **All coach-athlete queries**: Consistently filtered by approval_status

### **Supabase Auth Integration**
