# New Signup Flow Documentation

## Overview

We've redesigned the signup flow to be more user-friendly and consistent across all signup methods. The new flow forces users to choose a role early in the process and removes the athlete selection step that was previously only available to coaches and team managers.

## New Flow Structure

### 4-Step Process
1. **Signup Method Selection** - Choose between Google OAuth or email signup
2. **Role Selection** - Choose user role (Athlete, Coach, Team Manager)
3. **Account Information** - Email/password setup (skipped for Google OAuth users)
4. **Personal Information** - Name, phone, and other profile details

## User Journey

### Path 1: Google OAuth Signup
```
Step 1: Choose "Continue with Google"
   ↓
Step 2: Select role (Athlete/Coach/Team Manager)
   ↓
Step 3: Confirmation screen (no account setup needed)
   ↓
Step 4: Enter personal information
   ↓
Complete: Redirect to dashboard with toast message
```

### Path 2: Email Signup
```
Step 1: Choose "Continue with Email"
   ↓
Step 2: Select role (Athlete/Coach/Team Manager)
   ↓
Step 3: Enter email and password with strength indicator
   ↓
Step 4: Enter personal information
   ↓
Complete: Account creation + email verification prompt
```

- OAuth integration

## Configuration Requirements

### Google OAuth Setup
1. Configure Google Cloud Console credentials
2. Set up Supabase Google provider
3. Configure redirect URLs
4. Test OAuth flow in development and production

### Email Signup Setup
1. Configure Supabase email templates
2. Set up email verification
3. Configure password policies
4. Test email delivery

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Role-specific onboarding**: Custom welcome flows per role
2. **Social login expansion**: Add Facebook, Apple, LinkedIn
3. **Progressive profiling**: Collect additional info over time
4. **Signup analytics**: Track conversion rates by method
5. **A/B testing**: Test different flow variations

### Coach/Team Manager Features
Since we removed athlete selection from signup:
1. **Post-signup athlete linking**: Add athletes after account creation
2. **Team creation wizard**: Guide coaches through team setup
3. **Invitation system**: Let coaches invite athletes directly
4. **Bulk import**: Allow CSV upload of athlete data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OAuth redirect failures**
   - Check Google Console redirect URLs
   - Verify Supabase configuration
   - Ensure HTTPS in production

2. **Step validation errors**
   - Check `canProceedToNext()` logic
   - Verify form field requirements
   - Test all validation scenarios

3. **State persistence issues**
   - Check SignupContext implementation
   - Verify local storage handling
   - Test browser refresh scenarios

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase auth logs
3. Test in different browsers/devices
4. Check network requests in dev tools
