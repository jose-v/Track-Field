  - [x] Adapts to single/weekly/monthly assignment types
  - [x] **BONUS**: Multiple variants (`TodaysWorkoutCard`, `CompactAssignmentCard`)
- [x] **Create unified workout execution component** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - `src/components/UnifiedWorkoutExecution.tsx`
  - [x] Universal workout execution for all assignment types
  - [x] Built-in rest timer, progress tracking, exercise navigation
  - [x] Supports single workouts, weekly plans, monthly plans

## üõ† Phase 4: Specialized Workout Type Components **NEW FEATURES**
- [ ] EMOM Timer ‚Äì every-minute countdown with log **NEW**
- [ ] AMRAP Round Counter ‚Äì track rounds + time left **NEW**
- [ ] Circuit Tracker ‚Äì station rotation + rest logic **NEW**

## üñ• Phase 5: App Integration
- [ ] **Update Workout Execution Modal**
  - [ ] Use unified assignment system with new `workout_assignments` table
  - [ ] Integrate EMOM, AMRAP, circuit logic
- [ ] **Replace old components with unified `AssignmentCard`**:
  - [ ] AthleteWorkouts page
  - [ ] Dashboard
  - [ ] MonthlyPlanAssignments

## üß™ Phase 6: Migration & Testing
- [ ] **Test migration on staging with all workout types**
- [ ] **Run production migration during low-traffic hours**
- [ ] **Conduct full regression testing**
  - [ ] All flows: start ‚Üí progress ‚Üí reset ‚Üí complete
  - [ ] Test single, weekly, monthly assignment types
  - [ ] Verify EMOM, AMRAP, circuit functionality

## üßπ Phase 7: Cleanup
- [ ] **Remove old code**
  - [ ] `WorkoutCard`, `WorkoutCardWithProgress`, separate plan components
  - [ ] Legacy API methods and helpers
  - [ ] Old assignment tables and related logic
- [ ] **Drop old tables after stable verification**
  - [ ] `training_plan_assignments` (migrated to `workout_assignments`)
  - [ ] Any other legacy assignment tables

## üìö Phase 8: Documentation & Optimization
- [ ] **Update docs**
  - [ ] API, component usage, dev guide
  - [ ] New unified assignment system architecture
