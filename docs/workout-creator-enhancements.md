# Workout Creator Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the significant enhancements made to the coach portal workout creator to improve usability, functionality, and user experience.

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED FEATURES**

### 1. **Template Mode Athlete Assignment Restriction** ‚úÖ

**Problem**: When creating a template, Step 3 (Athlete Assignment) was still showing athletes and allowing assignment, which doesn't make logical sense since templates are meant for future use.

**Solution**: 
- Added conditional logic in Step 3 to detect when `isTemplate` is `true` **AND** user role is `coach`
- When creating a template, Step 3 now shows a disabled state with a clear message:
  - **Title**: "Templates Don't Need Athletes"
  - **Description**: "You cannot assign athletes when creating a template. Templates are saved for future use and can be assigned to athletes later."
- This only affects coaches - athletes and other users see the normal Step 3 flow

### 2. **Enhanced Save Buttons for Coaches** ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Only one "Save Workout" button with limited navigation options after saving.

**Solution**: 
- **Coach users** now have two specialized save buttons:
  - **"Save + New"** (Blue outline button): Saves the current workout and immediately resets the form to create another workout
  - **"Save + Done"** (Green button): Saves the workout and navigates to `/coach/monthly-plans`
- **Non-coach users** (athletes, etc.) still see the standard "Save Workout" button
- All buttons include proper loading states and error handling

### 3. **Draft Saving System** ‚úÖ

**Problem**: No way to save work-in-progress without finalizing and assigning workouts.

**Solution**: 
- **Coach-only feature** with comprehensive draft management:
  - **Auto-save**: Automatically saves drafts every 30 seconds while working
  - **Manual save**: "üíæ Save Draft" button in the navigation area
  - **Draft promotion**: When saving a final workout from a draft, the draft is promoted to a complete workout
  - **Visual feedback**: Shows "Draft saved [timestamp]" when auto-save occurs
  - **Persistent storage**: Drafts are stored in the database with `is_draft: true` flag

#### Draft System Features:
- üîÑ **Auto-save every 30 seconds** (coaches only)
- üíæ **Manual draft save button**
- üìä **Draft status indicators**
- üéØ **Draft-to-final promotion**
- üóëÔ∏è **Draft cleanup on finalization**

### 4. **Template Warning Message Fix** ‚úÖ

**Problem**: The "Items that need attention: No athletes assigned to this workout" warning was showing even when creating templates, which is inappropriate since templates don't need athlete assignments.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the warning logic in `getWarnings()` function to exclude the "no athletes assigned" warning when `isTemplate` is `true`
- Added `isTemplate` prop to `Step4ReviewSave` component to properly detect template mode
- Templates now skip athlete assignment warnings completely

### 5. **Template Card Button Improvements** ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Template cards had a generic "Use Template" button that wasn't very useful for management.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced single "Use Template" button with two action buttons:
  - **"Edit"** (Blue outline): Opens the workout creator for editing the template
  - **"Delete"** (Red outline): Deletes the template with confirmation dialog
- Better template management workflow with direct edit and delete actions
- Improved user experience for template operations

### 6. **Monthly Plans Page Tab Enhancement** ‚úÖ

**Problem**: The monthly plans page only had two tabs and no way to manage drafts or view deleted items.

**Solution**: 
- Added two new tabs to `/coach/monthly-plans`:
  - **"Drafts"** tab: Shows draft workouts that can be continued or deleted
  - **"Deleted"** tab: Shows deleted plans (prepared for future soft-delete functionality)
- Enhanced template tab functionality with proper edit/delete buttons
- Improved organization and workflow for coaches managing multiple plan states

#### New Tabs Features:
- üìù **Drafts Tab**: View and manage draft workouts with continue/delete options
- üóëÔ∏è **Deleted Tab**: Prepared for soft-delete functionality (shows placeholder for now)
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Enhanced Template Tab**: Direct edit/delete actions on template cards
- üîÑ **Individual Tab Refresh**: Each tab has its own refresh functionality

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Migration Required**

**IMPORTANT**: Before using the draft functionality, run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add draft support to workouts table
ALTER TABLE public.workouts 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_draft BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Create index for faster queries on draft workouts
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_workouts_is_draft_user 
ON public.workouts(user_id, is_draft) WHERE is_draft = true;

-- Update RLS policies to handle drafts
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can view their own drafts"
ON public.workouts FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND is_draft = true);

CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can update their own drafts"
ON public.workouts FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND is_draft = true);

CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can delete their own drafts"
ON public.workouts FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND is_draft = true);
```

## üéØ **User Experience Flow**

### For Coaches:
1. **Creating Templates**: Step 3 is automatically disabled with clear messaging, no athlete assignment warnings
2. **Template Management**: Direct edit/delete buttons on template cards for efficient management
3. **Draft Mode**: Work is auto-saved every 30 seconds, with manual save option and dedicated drafts tab
4. **Save Options**: Choose between "Save + New" (continue creating) or "Save + Done" (go to monthly plans)
5. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication when drafts are saved and progress is preserved
6. **Organized Workflow**: Four tabs in monthly plans for different states (Plans, Templates, Drafts, Deleted)

### For Athletes & Other Users:
- Standard workflow unchanged
