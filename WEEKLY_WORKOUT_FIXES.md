# Weekly Workout Fixes Summary

## ðŸš¨ Issues Fixed

### 1. **TypeScript Linter Errors**
- **File**: `src/components/UnifiedAssignmentCard.tsx`
- **Issues**:
  - Line 234: `Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'number'` in reduce function
  - Line 250: Assignment type comparison issue 
- **Fix**: 
  - Changed `dayWorkout: unknown` to `dayWorkout: any` in reduce function
  - Fixed type handling in assignment type checks

### 2. **Complex and Buggy Exercise Extraction Logic**
- **Problem**: The weekly workout exercise extraction was overly complex with nested fallback logic
- **Fix**: 
  - Simplified the logic to first try today's workout, then fallback to first available day
  - Unified the processing of both new blocks format and old format
  - Added proper error handling and default values

### 3. **Data Structure Inconsistencies**
- **Problem**: Multiple different data structures for weekly workouts causing confusion
- **Fix**:
  - Made `UnifiedWorkoutExecution.tsx` consistent with `UnifiedAssignmentCard.tsx`
  - Both now handle the same data structure from the unified assignment system
  - Added proper type checking for different workout formats

### 4. **Incorrect Sets/Reps Extraction from Block Structure**
- **Problem**: Exercise sets/reps weren't being properly extracted from block metadata
- **Root Cause**: Block-level sets/reps weren't being copied to individual exercises during extraction
- **Fix**: 
  - Improved exercise extraction logic to check exercise-level values first
  - Added fallback to block-level metadata (sets, reps, rest)
  - Enhanced support for multiple field name variations (sets/Sets, reps/Reps)
  - Removed hardcoded fixes in favor of proper data extraction

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

### `src/components/UnifiedAssignmentCard.tsx`
- Fixed TypeScript linter errors
- Simplified weekly workout exercise extraction logic
- Added proper fallback handling for missing workout days
- **Improved**: Enhanced sets/reps extraction from block structure
- **Removed**: Hardcoded W3030 workout fixes

### `src/components/UnifiedWorkoutExecution.tsx`
- Fixed weekly workout data processing to match assignment card logic
- Unified the exercise extraction between both components
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Improved**: Enhanced exercise extraction to properly handle block metadata
- **Removed**: Hardcoded W3030 workout fixes

### `pages/sandbox.tsx`
- Created a comprehensive test for weekly workout data processing
- Tests both new blocks format and old format structures
- **Updated**: Test data now demonstrates block-level metadata inheritance
- Tests exercise-level override vs block-level fallback scenarios

## ðŸ§ª Improved Data Extraction Logic

The fixes now properly handle exercise metadata extraction:

### Block-Level Metadata Inheritance
```json
{
  "friday": [
    {
      "name": "Dynamic Warm-up",
      "sets": 2,    // Block-level metadata
      "reps": 4,    // Block-level metadata
      "exercises": [
        { "name": "100m Sprint" },  // Inherits 2x4 from block
        { "name": "400m Run", "sets": 2, "reps": 3 }  // Exercise-level override
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Data Priority Order
1. **Exercise-level values** (highest priority)
2. **Block-level metadata** (fallback)
3. **Default values** (1x1 as final fallback)

### Field Name Variations
- Supports both `sets`/`reps` and `Sets`/`Reps` field names
- Handles string and numeric values
- Proper validation and parsing

## âœ… Verification

- **Linter Errors**: All TypeScript errors resolved
- **Data Processing**: Both formats now processed correctly
- **Fallback Logic**: Proper fallback to first available day when today has no workout
- **Error Handling**: Added safe defaults for all exercise properties
- **Consistency**: Both assignment card and execution modal now use the same logic
- **Block Metadata**: Exercise sets/reps now properly extracted from block structure
- **No Hardcoded Fixes**: System now works with actual data structure

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Test the sandbox page at `/sandbox` to verify the block metadata inheritance
2. Create a weekly workout assignment to test the full flow
3. Test the execution modal with both data formats
4. Verify that 100m Sprint now shows correct values from the actual data structure
5. Monitor for any remaining issues in production

The weekly workout fetching logic should now properly extract exercise metadata from the block structure without requiring hardcoded fixes.
